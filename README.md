UniHear: A Multilingual + ASL News Translator
Overview

UniHear is a multilingual and ASL (American Sign Language) translator designed to make global news accessible to everyone, regardless of language or hearing ability.
It converts YouTube videos and online articles into ASL video translations, multilingual text summaries, and audio summaries in various languages.
The platform is envisioned as a community driven hub for inclusive, local, and global news sharing, powered by Gemini for profanity filtering to ensure safe, respectful content.
Inspiration

Our inspiration stemmed from a simple observation: people connect most deeply with information in their own language.
When our grandparents preferred the news in their native tongue, we realized that language carries emotion, culture, and comfort.
Similarly, our conversations with members of the Deaf community revealed how traditional captions fail to capture nuance.

This led us to ask:
What if everyone could access news in the form that felt most natural to them whether through text, sound, or sign language?
What We Built

    ASL translation of videos for accessible visual comprehension
    Multilingual text and audio summaries of online news and YouTube content
    A Gemini powered profanity filter to maintain inclusivity and trust
    A JSON based storage system for simplicity and efficiency

How We Built It

Development began in VS Code with GitHub for version control.
After experimenting with Roo Code to generate the backend, we encountered several issues and decided to rewrite the backend manually.
Using Claude and ChatGPT for debugging and refinement, we replaced Postgres with a JSON storage model for flexibility and reduced complexity.
This combination of manual coding and AI assisted improvement produced a stable prototype emphasizing reliability and accessibility.
Lessons Learned

    AI accelerates development but cannot replace deliberate design or debugging.
    Accessibility requires attention to cultural and linguistic nuances, not just translation accuracy.
    Simplicity in storage and structure often leads to greater long term maintainability.

Challenges

    Debugging AI generated backend code and dependency conflicts
    Achieving realistic and expressive ASL video output
    Maintaining emotional and tonal consistency in multilingual summarization

Tech Stack

    Python 3.10+
    Flask for web framework
    Gemini API for text moderation
    ElevenLabs API for audio generation
    JSON storage for lightweight data persistence
    Git + GitHub for collaboration and version control
